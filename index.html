<h5 id="principles-of-programming-in-scala"><strong>Principles of programming in Scala</strong></h5>
<p><a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>, Gurgaon is glad to announce a <em>free for all</em> course in <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> programming. It is a 4 days course with live coding and hands on exercises (no slides, yay!).<br>This is the second workshop (the first one happened in <a href="http://www.punescala.org/training/2014/05/15/principles-of-programming-in-scala/">Pune</a>) in a series called as "Scala University" by ThoughtWorks. We eventually want to go to other cities and deliver free workshops in Scala, stay tuned!  
<br><br>This course will use Scala as a medium to introduce principles of both Object Oriented and Functional programming. It will show you that FP and OOP are yin-yang of each other. It will show how Scala unites them tastefully. We will also cover how to apply this novel combination to solve real world problems.</p>

<p>Here is the <a href="course-outline.html">outline</a> of topics covered in this course. Almost all examples will make use of the Scala standard library only. The course will NOT cover tools, frameworks, concurrency, actors etc. Those topics will be covered in future courses (for which the current course is a prerequisite). We promise the course will be fun and very different than the other trainings which you might have attended earlier.</p>

<h5 id="what-is-the-selection-criteria"><strong>What is the selection Criteria?</strong></h5>
<p>You must be a hands on programmer to apply. It does not matter if you are a university student, an experienced polyglot programmer or a non-comp-science professional who knows programming, as long as you can take a simple coding test. The coding problem will be sent via emails to all those who register. You can use any programming language of your liking to solve it. By design, the difficulty level of the problem will be low. It will test your basic coding skills and commitment to finish a given task (hopefully, implying the commitment to finish the course).</p>

<h5 id="what-is-the-deadline"><strong>What is the deadline?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>16th July</strong> is the deadline for registration and code submission. We can only accommodate a small number in a batch. So, please hurry up and <a href="register.html">register now!</a>. The classroom size will be around 30 people with a mix of candidates who qualify and some ThoughtWorks developers. If more participants qualify than the batch size, we will accommodate them in future batches (yes, we are planning to do it more than once).</p>

<h5 id="why-is-thoughtworks-doing-it-for-free"><strong>Why is ThoughtWorks doing it for free?</strong></h5>
<p>This is the same course we otherwise offer as a commercial corporate training. So why are we doing it for free? Well, we have been active Scala users for a long time but, we see that Scala awareness in the local community is not great. Our main objective of this programme is to bridge this gap. That does not mean it is restricted to only Delhiites. If you can manage your own travel and stay, you are most welcome to apply.</p>

<h5 id="when-is-it"><strong>When is it?</strong></h5>
<p>The course dates are <strong>24th-27th July 2014 (Thu-Sun)</strong>. Yes, you will have to put in 2 working days and the entire weekend to complete the course. The session timings will be <em>9am-5pm</em>. Breakfast, lunch and beverages will be provided by ThoughtWorks.</p>

<h5 id="where-is-it"><strong>Where is it?</strong></h5>
<p>The location of training is our <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/nMi9h">Gurgaon office</a>:</p>
